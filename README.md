Project notes - This will be new version of the Caprica Tech blog page.

## I hope some of the ideas here help somebody else.

Things I'd like showing here:

- AWS labs
- IaC with Terraform, perhaps adding more Hashicorp products as I have to time to learn them. Besides Vault which is hot right now and super usefull, having Consul and Nomad experience would be super!
- FreeBSD with some ZFS tests on the cloud.

## Vintage computing

There are some vintage computing that could be fun here, maybe some IPX/SPX and AppleTalk labs, who knows :)
